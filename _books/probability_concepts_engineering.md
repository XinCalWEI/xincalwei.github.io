This book introduces probability and statistics through realistic engineering examples. Intended for sophomore–junior engineering students, it emphasizes probabilistic modeling and the fundamentals of statistical inference for practical engineering applications.

This second edition—authored by Alfredo Ang and Wilson Tang—simplifies core concepts while adding expanded topics such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals in regression. It aims to help students build the ability to formulate and solve real engineering problems.

Each principle is demonstrated with examples from engineering and the physical sciences, especially civil and environmental engineering. Exercises at the end of each chapter reinforce conceptual understanding and practical skills.
