Rainfall-induced landslides occur worldwide. With global climate change, their frequency is rising and their consequences are becoming increasingly severe. Existing studies often approach this issue from a single perspective—correlating landslides with rainfall patterns, geomorphology, or hydrology to establish threshold-based predictions; conducting slope stability analyses using geomechanical approaches; or assessing risks using field records.

*Rainfall Induced Soil Slope Failure: Stability Analysis and Probabilistic Assessment* integrates probabilistic methods with geotechnical modeling of rainfall-triggered slope failures in unsaturated soils. It covers theoretical rainfall infiltration models, stability analyses, reliability analysis through coupled hydro-mechanical simulations, slope failures involving cracks, gravels, and spatially heterogeneous soils, and probabilistic model calibration using measurements. It emphasizes uncertainty in rainfall-induced landslides and provides state-of-the-art tools to quantify probability and risk.

## Topics include:

- Failure mechanisms of rainfall-induced slopes
- Common infiltration and stability analysis methods
- Infiltration and stability of cracked slopes and colluvium
- Probabilistic methods for stability evaluation
- Effects of spatial variability in unsaturated soil slopes

and more.
