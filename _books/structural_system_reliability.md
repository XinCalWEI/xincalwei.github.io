Based on material taught at UC Berkeley, this textbook provides a rigorous and comprehensive introduction to structural and system reliability analysis. It covers first- and second-order reliability methods, system reliability, simulation approaches, time- and space-variant reliability, and Bayesian parameter estimation and updating.

Advanced topics include finite-element reliability methods, stochastic structural dynamics, reliability-based optimal design, and Bayesian networks. Numerous well-designed examples illustrate both theory and real applications. Homework problems appear throughout the book.

With all essential probability background included, plus online instructor materials, this book is ideal for senior undergraduate and graduate courses in structural and system reliability in civil, environmental, or mechanical engineering.
