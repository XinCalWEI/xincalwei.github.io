**AGU25 – Toward Reliable and Scalable Geohazard Intelligence: From Multiscale Sensing to Open Data Foundations**

---

To address the growing challenges of geohazards, we invite contributions that advance reliable and scalable machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) approaches for the detection, monitoring, and prediction of geohazards, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, landslides, and surface subsidence. We especially welcome works that:

1. Integrate multi-scale sensing technologies (e.g., remote sensing and distributed fiber-optic sensing) with ML/AI to support both pre- and post-event assessment of geohazards as well as their cascading impacts in diverse environmental settings, such as urbanized, remote, post-disturbance, and cold landscapes;
2. Develop interpretable and knowledge-guided (e.g., physics-informed) ML/AI to reveal the driving factors and physical mechanisms;
3. Evaluate and improve model robustness in extreme and data-scarce scenarios through cross-region and cross-scenario model transfer, uncertainty quantification, and real-time data fusion;
4. Develop open-source, multi-scale geohazard datasets to support the training and testing of foundation models toward reliable, scalable, real-world AI deployment.
