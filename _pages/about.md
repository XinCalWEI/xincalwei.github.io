I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan, supported by the Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship funded by [Schmidt Sciences](https://www.schmidtsciences.org/). I earned my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering, specializing in Geotechnical Engineering, from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, including a period as a visiting scholar in structural engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.

My research interests include risk, reliability, and resilience analysis of natural hazards, leveraging interdisciplinary approaches such as remote sensing, geospatial modeling, and both data-driven and physics-based methods. I am exploring integrated AI-physics solutions to understand the impact of past landslides on communities and to develop risk assessment tools aimed at mitigating future impacts.

<!-- Example template content (commented out for reference):
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
