## [Journey Through CEE: from undergrad to future success](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/2024/12/16/building-bridges-advancing-community-at-u-m-civil-environmental-engineering/)

While there are many formal opportunities for undergraduates to engage with the department and professors, there are fewer informal channels for them to connect with PhD students, postdocs, or faculty members—to ask questions, seek guidance, and build relationships.

This project aims to establish a study group named "Journey Through CEE: from undergrad to future success" specifically for undergraduate students within the Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) department. Each study group meeting will feature several speakers (PhD students, postdocs, or professors) who will share their insights on various themes, including course learning experiences, academic research, career planning, and even personal life experiences (like managing stress and overcoming challenges).

The primary goal of the study group is to increase communication channels between undergraduates and PhD students, postdocs, or professors (helping undergraduate students feel more connected to the CEE community), while offering mentorship in a supportive, informal setting. The study group will help students build healthier mindsets, increase academic exposure, develop critical thinking skills, and explore both academic and career pathways.

## ["Urban Hazards and Risk Management" Event](https://www.sohu.com/a/324524017_363254)

At SJTU, I co-designed science outreach activities for elementary school students in China as part of the "Urban Hazards and Risk Management" event, held in 2019 at Tongji University and organized by the Chinese Society for Civil Engineering, with co-hosts including SJTU, the ISSMGE Technical Committee TC304, and the journal Underground Space.

The program combined expert lectures, hands-on activities, interactive games, and laboratory demonstrations to introduce disaster awareness and risk management concepts to young audiences in an engaging and accessible way.

I contributed to designing activities such as VR-based fire escape training and wave-dissipating seawall demonstrations, which transformed abstract natural hazard concepts into tangible experiences. These activities strengthened students' understanding of disaster risks, fostered curiosity about science and engineering, and encouraged early awareness of community resilience.
