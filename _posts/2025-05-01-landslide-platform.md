Recent advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved landslide-related applications, including detection, early warning, and susceptibility mapping. Generative AI technologies further offer new opportunities to accelerate landslide research by enabling rapid prototyping and iteration of ML/DL workflows. However, most existing models are trained on datasets tied to specific regions or landslide types, leading to limited or untested generalization across diverse geographic and environmental settings.

While efforts to publish open-access landslide datasets have increased, these resources remain fragmented across individual publications, institutional repositories, and project-specific websites. As a result, researchers often spend substantial time locating, retrieving, and preparing data for new regions. Progress is still constrained by the lack of high-quality, high-volume, standardized, and accessible datasets.

To address this gap, we present a community-curated, open-access, and evolving platform that aggregates global landslide inventories and related geospatial data, along with detailed metadata for each dataset. Metadata fields include inventory type (e.g., point, polygon), record count, spatial resolution, geographic coverage, input features (e.g., optical imagery, elevation, land use), ML/DL models used, evaluation settings, and whether cross-regional generalization was tested. Users can search, filter, and download datasets through an interactive map-based interface. The platform also encourages community contributions through a simple upload workflow.

This platform serves as a centralized hub for high-quality, globally sourced landslide and geospatial data, supporting the development and benchmarking of reliable, scalable, and generalizable AI models for both fundamental research and real-world applications.
